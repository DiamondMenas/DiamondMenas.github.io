        <p>Our premier tool for libraries is the Unsub dashboard (formerly called Unpaywall Journals).<br> It mashes up journal-level OA data with your institution's citation patterns and COUNTER download info,<br> then builds a comprehensive model to forecast how cancellation or subscription decisions will affect library costs and fulfillment--<br>letting you confidently made decisions about your Big Deals and individual subscriptions.<br> We were named "Most Impactful New Product" at the 2019 Charleston Conference,<br> and hundreds of libraries are already users..</p>

     <p>Nearly all great ideas follow a similar creative process and this article explains how this process works.<br><br> Understanding this is important because creative thinking is one of the most useful skills you can possess. Nearly every problem you face in work and in life can benefit from innovative solutions, lateral thinking, and creative ideas.

     <p>First, Ives gathered new material. He spent two years working as a printer’s apprentice and then four years running the photographic laboratory at Cornell University. These experiences gave him a lot of material to draw upon and make associations between photography and printing.</p>
    <h2 id="princess-for-a-day">What I would do if I were a princess for a day</h2> 
     <h6><em>11/22/2023</em></h6>

     <p>Ives quickly translated his vision into reality and patented his printing approach in 1881. He spent the remainder of the decade improving upon it. By 1885,<br> he had developed a simplified process that delivered even better results. The Ives Process, as it came to be known, reduced the cost of printing images by 15x and remained the standard printing technique for the next 80 years.</p>
     
     <h2 id="too-thick">You are drawing on your eyebrows too thick. Let me help</h2>

     <p>Third, Ives stepped away from the problem. In this case, he went to sleep for a few hours before his flash of insight. Letting creative challenges sit for longer periods of time can work as well. Regardless of how long you step away, you need to do something that interests you and takes your mind off of the problem.</p>
     
     <h2 id="nerdy-boys">Why you should date nerdy boys!</h2>
     <h6><em>11/24/2023</em></h6>

     <p>Fourth, his idea returned to him. Ives awoke with the solution to his problem laid out before him. (On a personal note, I often find creative ideas hit me just as I am lying down for sleep. Once I give my brain permission to stop working for the day, the solution appears easily.)</p>
     
     <h2 id="pink-season">Why pink is in season, every season!</h2>

     <p>One way to approach creative challenges is by following the five-step process of 1) gathering material, 2) intensely working over the material in your mind, 3) stepping away from the problem, 4) allowing the idea to come back to you naturally, and 5) testing your idea in the real world and adjusting it based on feedback.</p>

     <p>At some point, she decided to give it another try and managed to make her bed four days in a row—a seemingly trivial feat. However, on the morning of that fourth day, when she finished making the bed, she also picked up a sock and folded a few clothes lying around the bedroom.<br> Next, she found herself in the kitchen, pulling the dirty dishes out of the sink and loading them into the dishwasher, then reorganizing the Tupperware in a cupboard and placing an ornamental pig on the counter as a centerpiece.</p>
     <h2 id="wild-raccoons">Wild raccoons are terrorizing my roommates!</h2>
     <h6><em>11/27/2023</em></h6>
     <img src="https://cdn.kastatic.org/third_party/javascript-khansrc/live-editor/build/images/animals/crocodiles.png"width="203">
     
     <p>She later explained, “My act of bed-making had set off a chain of small household tasks… I felt like a grown-up—a happy, legit grown-up with a made bed, a clean sink, one decluttered cupboard, and a pig on the counter. I felt like a woman who had miraculously pulled herself up from the energy-sucking Bermuda Triangle of Household Chaos.”</p>
     
     <h2 id="girlie-pop">I think 'Girliepop' is so cute!</h2>

     <p>For example, a 2012 study from researchers at Northwestern University found that when people decreased their amount of sedentary leisure time each day, they also reduced their daily fat intake. The participants were never specifically told to eat less fat, but their nutrition habits improved as a natural side effect because they spent less time on the couch watching television and mindlessly eating. One habit led to another, one domino knocked down the next.</p>

     <p>The Domino Effect holds for negative habits as well. You may find that the habit of checking your phone leads to the habit of clicking social media notifications which leads to the habit of browsing social media mindlessly which leads to another 20 minutes of procrastination.</p>
